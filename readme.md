# Tour Project

Built using modern technologies: node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose.
I build an API and Server-side-rendering page with Pug templates. In this project I practice my MVC architecture, Error handling,
Authentication, Authorization, security skills and more...

I make this project from my udemy course and I learn a lot of new things about Nodejs.
